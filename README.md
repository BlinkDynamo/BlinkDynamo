## Hi, Iâ€™m @BlinkDynamo
#### I'm 22 years old and in school for computer programming and analysis. This is what i'm up to on currently:

- I'm learning Python, C#, C++, SQL, and Javascript, both in school and outside of school.
- I'm working to get comfortable using and understanding data structures and algorhythms. 
- I'm looking for any work (paid or unpaid) that can give me experience with programming. I'm very excited to learn more- whatever it is.
- I'm reaching out to experienced programmers in the CS space to find mentors and guidance.
- I'm aspiring to create larger and more powerful things that help people.
