- Hi, Iâ€™m @BlinkDynamo
- I'm 22 years old and in school for computer programming and analysis.
- I'm learning Python, C#, C++, SQL, and Javascript. I'm looking to get a very comfortable understanding with data structures and algorhythms as well. 
- I'm looking for any work (paid or unpaid) that can give me experience with programming. I'm very excited to learn more- whatever it is.
- You can get into contact with me via email at [blindcollective@protonmail.com]
