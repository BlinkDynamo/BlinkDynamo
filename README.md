## Hi, Iâ€™m Josh (@BlinkDynamo)

### This is what i'm up to on currently:
- I'm learning mostly C and C++, with a bit of Python for scripting stuff.
- I'm working to get comfortable using new data structures and algorithms. 
- I'm looking for achievable projects to contribute to that will improve my knowlege and skills.
- I'm aspiring to create larger and more powerful things that help people.
